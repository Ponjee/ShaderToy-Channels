# ShaderToy-iChannels
The textures, cubemaps, volumes, videos, and music are all the iChannels from ShaderToy.com.
The cubemaps are laid out as 6 textures.

I don't know about the license, but all credit goes to ShaderToy and/or the source of those files.
I got these files from this site: https://shadertoyunofficial.wordpress.com/2019/07/23/shadertoy-media-files/ so credit to them too.
